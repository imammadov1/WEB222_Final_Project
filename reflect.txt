	In this project i have learned the main purpose of the Html form is to get the input from user 
	to submit it to server. There are multiple types of Html form we have used in this project. They 
	are textarea and input. Textarea is for to get some text or description from the user. Input is 
	for to get different types of inputs from user. We got familir email, password, text, radio and 
	submit types in the final project. We can name this input using label element. for submit type we 
	can use an attribute "value".

 	Input Attributes:
 	Id stand for identification of input element,
 	Type is specifying the input type. here are the common ones(text, password,email, radio etc.) 
 	Name is specifying name of value being sent to server.
 	Required is specifying the the field must be filled.
 	Placeholder is specifying the text appeared in the input are.
 	Tabindex stands for that user can jump from input to unput using tab.
 	Hidden is used to hide the input from the users view.
 	Pattern is specifying the submitted expression to the input.
 	Auto-focus is specifying the focus of the page after it loaded.
 	
 I am usually using developer tools in firefox. always try to inspect site to fix the bugs. It is really helpful. You can even edit your page without changeing the main code.
